# Final Project

## Background Story

You are a Consultant Data Scientist employed at E-Corp and your newest client, Piggy Bank, has come to you with a problem, they are trying to bring their banking systems into the 21st century by implementing a Machine Learning model, but they cannot decide on which model to implement.

To help you along your journey, Piggy Bank has supplied you with a sample data set.

With this data set, Piggy Bank would like you to advise them on what Machine Learning models they should consider implementing to help speed up the process of classifying the creditworthiness of individuals who are applying for a financial service, mainly in the form of loans and credit cards.

### The Data set

* Comprises of 1,225 rows and 15 columns.
* Originally sourced from Kaggle.
* A lot of the data is text based attributes.

### Work Flow
#### Analysis and Visualisations

I started off this journey with some simple data analysis and visualisations to help me better understand the data set.

#### Machine Learning models 

I will be conducted tests with 3 different Machine Learning models to see which one handles this data set the best, the Machine Learning models in question are:

* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes

### Analytical Report

To conclude my findings, I have written a report which you can find in this GitHub repository, I belive it is a comprehensive evaluation of my findings.
